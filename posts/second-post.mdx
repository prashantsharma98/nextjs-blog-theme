Today I was going through Twitter posts and thinking about things I realized, I always expected the best out of people always. Like cheating or frauding someone was never any option for me. I always wanted everything to be good. I never fathomed that someone could lie, cheat or do something wrong for other people. 

Now slowly I am realizing how wrong I was. Earlier I thought about it as other people just making mistakes. Just small mistakes. Now slowly I am realizing that people lie on purpose. They fake concern. They prop up fake causes for promoting their own brand. They make up fake propagandas for their own benefits. They take advantage of the emotions of innocent people. 

And at the end of the day people like me who talk about these things come under their crosshairs. We are boycotted, cancelled, shunned, whatever you might want to call it. 

The problem with today's information exchange system is that we add emotions to everything rather than talking in facts. They talk about it in emotions rather than what the matter of fact is. 

Well, end of the day, who am I to say anything to anyone. My motto is "Gain knowledge, Give knowledge". There are a small group of people in this world whom I consider real philosophers. I like to think I am in that group. We tend to think about this world in a broad sense. Looking at the world from a far view. We talk about things which people are afraid to talk about. We are the people that are most misunderstood. Then at the end of the day, after we have said what we wanted to say, after a hundred years, someone comes up and says "Oh, They were right about that." Then people say they were inspired by what was said a hundred years ago. We become the voice that is echoed in their heads, but not what they say in life, not what they follow in life, something not practical.
